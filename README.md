This is a copy of an academic project I contributed to. The project is a student apartment search & rental website built with [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) 3.x.

## Project details
**Module title**: Global Distributed Software Development.

**Subject Knowledge & Skills:** 
After Ô¨Ånishing this module students have in-depth knowledge of how to design and implement a mid-size distributed Web-application in a global setting. They understand how to cooperate with team members with different cultural backgrounds at other locations and in other time zones. They know how to apply programming techniques for building applications that meet customers requirements.

**Content/Syllabus:**
Students engaged in a group project in order to experience and practice key aspects of software engineering in a setting that simulates globally distributed software development companies. Students acted in the typical roles as developers, technical leads, and managers. The module offered comprehensive and advanced coverage of practical methods and tools of software engineering, as well as its organizational, teamwork and communicational aspects. Special emphasis was on iterative, incremental, agile and user-centered design methodologies and on global software engineering, where teams were located in geographically and culturally dispersed areas. 
This project provided an integrative experience in software project organization and teamwork, thus complementing student's fundamental skills in computer science.
